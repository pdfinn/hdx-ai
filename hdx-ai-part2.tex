\begin{frame}{A Scenario to Consider}
    \begin{columns}[c]
        \begin{column}{0.48\textwidth}
            \textbf{Your company deploys a hiring algorithm that:}

            \vspace{2mm}

            \begin{itemize}
                \item Makes demonstrably \textit{better} hiring decisions than humans
                \item Reduces bias against protected groups in final outcomes
                \item Secretly accesses candidates' private social media to do so
                \item Candidates have no idea this is happening

\begin{frame}{Why Does This Feel Wrong?}
    \begin{columns}[c]
        \begin{column}{0.55\textwidth}
            \textbf{The outcomes are good:}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Better hires
                \item Less discrimination
                \item Company benefits
            \end{itemize}

            \vspace{3mm}

            \textbf{But something is violated:}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Privacy without consent
                \item People used as means to an end
                \item Autonomy undermined

        \end{column}
    \end{columns}

    \vspace{3mm}

    \begin{block}{The Core Tension}
        Good outcomes don't automatically make something ethical. We need sharper tools to understand why.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The Problem with ``AI Ethics''}
    \textbf{The term is used to mean many different things:}

    \vspace{3mm}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Safety}: The system doesn't malfunction or cause accidents
        \item \textbf{Fairness}: The system doesn't discriminate
        \item \textbf{Privacy}: The system respects data boundaries
        \item \textbf{Transparency}: Users understand how decisions are made
        \item \textbf{Accountability}: Someone is responsible when things go wrong
    \end{itemize}

    \vspace{3mm}

    \begin{alertblock}{The Challenge}
        Without clear distinctions, ``ethics'' becomes a vague umbrella that obscures more than it reveals. We need sharper tools.
    \end{alertblock}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Ethics vs. Safety: A Key Distinction}
    \begin{columns}[t]
        \begin{column}{0.48\textwidth}
            \textbf{Wrong} (Ethics concern)
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Violates rights, dignity, autonomy
                \item May not make anyone \textit{measurably} worse off
                \item Fix: governance, policy, redesign
            \end{itemize}
        \end{column}
        \begin{column}{0.48\textwidth}
            \textbf{Harm} (Safety concern)
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Makes someone \textit{less well off}
                \item Measurable impact
                \item Can occur even when working as designed
                \item Fix: controls, testing, monitoring
            \end{itemize}
        \end{column}
    \end{columns}

    \vspace{2mm}

    \begin{block}{Key Insight}
        Both can happen when systems work perfectly. The difference is whether someone ends up \textbf{worse off} (harm) or has their \textbf{rights violated} (wrong).
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{When Harm and Wrong Overlap}
    \textbf{The hiring algorithm case:}

    \vspace{2mm}

    A candidate is rejected by an AI system that systematically down-ranks people based on protected characteristics.

    \vspace{2mm}

    \begin{columns}[t]
        \begin{column}{0.48\textwidth}
            \textbf{The Harm}\\
            Lost job opportunity, economic damage

            \vspace{2mm}

            \textit{But}: People lose jobs for legitimate reasons all the time. Harm alone doesn't make it unethical.
        \end{column}
        \begin{column}{0.48\textwidth}
            \textbf{The Wrong}\\
            Their characteristics were \textit{used against them}

            \vspace{2mm}

            \textit{This} is what makes it unethical---even if they wouldn't have gotten the job anyway.
        \end{column}
    \end{columns}

    \vspace{3mm}

    \begin{alertblock}{Key Point}
        It's unethical because someone was \textbf{wronged}, not because they were \textbf{harmed}.
    \end{alertblock}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Why Sharp Distinctions Matter}
    \textbf{Different problems require different solutions:}

    \vspace{3mm}

    \begin{tabular}{p{3cm}p{5cm}p{5cm}}
        & \textbf{Harm (Safety)} & \textbf{Wrong (Ethics)} \\
        \hline
        \textbf{Question} & Is someone worse off? & Were rights violated? \\
        \textbf{Nature} & Measurable, quantifiable & Categorical \\
        \textbf{Response} & Risk controls, mitigation & Governance intervention \\
        \textbf{Expertise} & Technical teams & Cross-functional + legal \\
        \textbf{Risk profile} & Often insurable & Existential/reputational \\
        \textbf{Public perception} & ``Something caused damage'' & ``They chose to do this'' \\
    \end{tabular}

    \vspace{4mm}

    Conflating safety and ethics leads to inadequate responses to both.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Legal Wrongs vs Ethical Wrongs}
    \textbf{Are they the same thing?}

    \vspace{3mm}

    \begin{columns}[t]
        \begin{column}{0.48\textwidth}
            \textbf{Legal but ethically wrong}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Training AI on scraped data
                \item Facial recognition in retail
                \item Manipulative recommendation algorithms
            \end{itemize}
        \end{column}
        \begin{column}{0.48\textwidth}
            \textbf{The wealthy actor problem}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Fines treated as ``cost of business''
                \item Compensation doesn't deter
                \item Need: personal liability, license revocation
            \end{itemize}
        \end{column}
    \end{columns}

    \vspace{3mm}

    \begin{block}{Implication}
        ``We're not breaking any laws'' is not an ethics defense.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

%% --- Case studies: Wrong vs Harm ---

\begin{frame}{Case Study: Wrong, Harm, or Both?}
    \textbf{Instructions}: For each scenario, identify whether it's primarily a \textbf{wrong} (ethics), a \textbf{harm} (safety), or both. Be prepared to explain why.

    \vspace{4mm}

    \textbf{Case 1}: A chatbot for a mental health app gives a user advice that worsens their condition due to a hallucination.

    \vspace{3mm}

    \textbf{Case 2}: A company scrapes public social media posts to train a facial recognition system without users' knowledge.

    \vspace{3mm}

    \textbf{Case 3}: An autonomous vehicle's sensor fails in rain, causing a collision with a pedestrian.

    \vspace{3mm}

    \textbf{Case 4}: A content recommendation algorithm, working exactly as designed, shows increasingly extreme content to maximize engagement.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Case Study: Answers}
    \textbf{Case 1}: Mental health chatbot hallucination\\
    \textcolor{hdxpurple}{\textbf{Harm}} --- System malfunctioned. Engineering fix needed.

    \vspace{3mm}

    \textbf{Case 2}: Scraping social media for facial recognition\\
    \textcolor{hdxpurple}{\textbf{Wrong}} --- No malfunction. Users' data was \textit{used} without consent. May cause no tangible harm, but still violates autonomy.

    \vspace{3mm}

    \textbf{Case 3}: Autonomous vehicle sensor failure\\
    \textcolor{hdxpurple}{\textbf{Harm}} --- System failed. No one was wronged; something went wrong.

    \vspace{3mm}

    \textbf{Case 4}: Extremism-promoting recommendation algorithm\\
    \textcolor{hdxpurple}{\textbf{Wrong}} --- Working as designed. The system \textit{uses} psychological vulnerabilities to maximize engagement. Governance intervention needed.

%% --- Transition to business case ---

\begin{frame}{AI Ethics as Business Imperative}
    \textbf{With this framework in mind:}

    \vspace{3mm}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Reputation}: Ethics failures suggest values problems
        \item \textbf{Regulatory}: Laws increasingly target \textit{wrongs}, not just harms
        \item \textbf{Legal}: Liability for discrimination, not just malfunction
        \item \textbf{Talent}: Engineers want to build systems that don't \textit{wrong} people
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{alertblock}{Key Insight}
        The reputational half-life of AI ethics failures is measured in years.

\begin{frame}{High-Profile AI Ethics Failures}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Amazon}: Recruiting tool showed gender bias
        \item \textbf{Microsoft}: Tay chatbot offensive within hours
        \item \textbf{Apple}: Credit card gender bias investigation
        \item \textbf{Clearview AI}: Banned in multiple countries
        \item \textbf{COMPAS}: Criminal justice racial bias
    \end{itemize}

%% --- Three Core Wrongs Framework ---

\begin{frame}{AI Alignment: When Goals Diverge from Values}
    \textbf{What is Alignment?}

    \vspace{2mm}

    An AI system is \textit{aligned} when it pursues goals consistent with human values and intentions.

    \vspace{3mm}

    \textbf{Misalignment is a Wrong Because:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The system acts \textit{against} the interests of those it serves
        \item Even ``successful'' operation violates the implicit contract
        \item Users are treated as means to ends they didn't choose
    \end{itemize}

    \vspace{2mm}

    \begin{block}{Example}
        A recommendation algorithm optimized for engagement that promotes outrage content. It's \textit{working perfectly}---but pursuing a goal misaligned with user wellbeing.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The Three Core Wrongs}
    \textbf{A principled framework for AI ethics:}

    \vspace{3mm}

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Misalignment}\\
              AI pursuing goals inconsistent with human values\\
              {\small\textit{``The system works against my interests''}}

        \vspace{2mm}

        \item \textbf{Unfairness}\\
              Treating people differently based on protected characteristics\\
              {\small\textit{``The system used my characteristics against me''}}

        \vspace{2mm}

        \item \textbf{Autonomy Violation}\\
              Manipulating, deceiving, or undermining self-determination\\
              {\small\textit{``The system didn't respect my agency''}}
    \end{enumerate}

    \vspace{2mm}

    \begin{alertblock}{Each Maps to a Relationship Aspect}
        Alignment (shared purpose), Fairness (equal treatment), Autonomy (respect for agency)
    \end{alertblock}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Unfairness: Using Characteristics Against People}
    \textbf{Bias is the mechanism; unfairness is the wrong.}

    \vspace{2mm}

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Historical}: Training data reflects past discrimination
        \item \textbf{Representation}: Data over/under-represents groups
        \item \textbf{Measurement}: Features as proxies for protected characteristics
        \item \textbf{Aggregation}: One model for diverse populations
        \item \textbf{Evaluation}: Test data doesn't match deployment context
    \end{enumerate}

    \vspace{2mm}

    \begin{alertblock}{Key Insight}
        Bias is a \textbf{wrong}, not just a harm. Even if outcomes look statistically fine, individuals may still be wronged by \textit{how} the decision was made.
    \end{alertblock}
\end{frame}

    \begin{block}{Ethics Governance}
        Bias mitigation is part of the \textbf{ethics track}---preventing wrongs even when systems ``work.''
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

%% --- Autonomy Violation: Third Core Wrong ---

\begin{frame}{Autonomy Violation: Undermining Self-Determination}
    \textbf{AI can violate autonomy in distinct ways:}

    \vspace{2mm}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Manipulation}: Nudging users toward decisions without awareness\\
              {\small Dark patterns, algorithmic persuasion, exploiting psychological biases}

        \item \textbf{Deception}: Misrepresenting AI capabilities or nature\\
              {\small Making people think they're talking to a human, hiding AI involvement}

        \item \textbf{Coercion}: Removing meaningful choice\\
              {\small Algorithmic gatekeeping, ``take it or leave it'' AI decisions}

        \item \textbf{Surveillance}: Monitoring that chills autonomous behavior\\
              {\small Even when data isn't ``used against'' someone, awareness changes behavior}
    \end{itemize}

    \vspace{2mm}

    \begin{alertblock}{Distinct from Unfairness}
        A system can be perfectly unbiased yet still manipulate users into purchases they wouldn't otherwise make. That's an autonomy violation.
    \end{alertblock}
\end{frame}
